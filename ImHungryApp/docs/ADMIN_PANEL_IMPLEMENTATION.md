## Security Considerations

1. ✅ Admin flag required for all admin functions
2. ✅ Hidden access method (7-tap trigger on "Im" text in login screen)
3. ✅ Authentication verification on every admin screen
4. ✅ Action logging for audit trail
5. ✅ Database triggers prevent banned/suspended users from posting
6. ✅ Server-side validation (via Supabase RLS policies if configured)

## Performance Optimizations

1. ✅ Indexed database fields (is_banned, is_suspended, is_featured)
2. ✅ Paginated queries with limits
3. ✅ Efficient search queries
4. ✅ Cached admin status
5. ✅ Minimal re-renders in UI components

## Known Limitations

1. No bulk operations (must act on items one at a time)
2. No role-based admin permissions (single admin level)
3. No automated moderation rules
4. No content approval queue
5. Mass upload requires creating deals individually

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Bulk deal editing
- [ ] Content approval queue for new deals
- [ ] More granular admin roles (moderator vs full admin)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Advanced filtering for reports/deals/users
- [ ] Export data to CSV
- [ ] Email notifications for admin actions
- [ ] Scheduled suspension expiration notifications

### Low Priority
- [ ] Automated moderation rules
- [ ] Custom analytics date ranges
- [ ] Deal performance tracking over time
- [ ] User behavior analytics

## Support & Maintenance

1. Review pending reports weekly
2. Check admin action logs for unusual activity
3. Monitor analytics for app health
